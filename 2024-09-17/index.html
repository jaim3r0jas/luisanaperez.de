                        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                        <p> Weâ€™ve come a long way since September 17th, 2016. Through lots of fun, losing dear family,
                            several moves, new family (our twins), and many (bold) challenges, weâ€™ve grown stronger
                            together (that's the truth). This is my gift to you, I've chosen to do something with what I
                            know (software engineering) to give you a little piece of something I like to think I do
                            well, and surely enjoy. But this gift is tribute to you, a testament of the great things you
                            do, and as a side gig it also celebrates your favorite city. </p>

                        <div class="border border-2 padding">
                            <p> Hi there Chula, <br><br> Merry Christmas! I hope this letter finds you well and happy. I
                                wanted to give you something special this year, something that would remind you of the
                                city thatâ€™s always held a special place in your heart even before you visited it for the
                                first time. <br><br> New York has always been the oneâ€” a place full of energy, dreams,
                                endless possibilities, and of course fashion. Over the years, it has become a little
                                piece of our story too. <br><br> Since 2013, weâ€™ve built something incredible. Not just
                                a marriage but a family, a home, and a bond that, has endured everything life has thrown
                                at us and your strength, belief and true love has been the glue that has kept us
                                together. <br><br> From our twins filling the house with laughter (and chaos!) to moving
                                countries, packing boxes, and unpacking dreams, our journey has been anything but
                                ordinary. Through it all, one thing has remained: my unwavering love and respect for
                                you. <br><br> This gift is a small reminder of the big promise I made to you: to always
                                work for your happiness, to listen to your dreams, and to hold your hand through every
                                adventure and every challenge. <br><br> Hereâ€™s to us, to the love that keeps growing,
                                and to the dreams weâ€™re yet to chase (including traveling to NY). Iâ€™m in for the long
                                ride, now and always. <br><br> With love, Jaime </p>
